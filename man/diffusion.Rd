\title{The Ratcliff Diffusion Model}
\usage{
drd(t, pl, i, precision = 3)

prd(t, pl, i, precision = 3, maxt = 10000)

rrd(n, pl, precision = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{a vector of RTs.}

\item{n}{desired number of observations.}

\item{pl}{a list of paramaters in the following order: \code{c("a","v","t0","d","sz","sv","st0","z")}}

\item{i}{the boundary to test, upper = 2, lower = 1}

\item{precision}{precision(?)}

\item{maxt}{maximum \code{t0} value for to stop integration problems (\code{prd} only).}
}
\value{
\code{drd} gives the density, \code{prd} gives the dsitribution function, and \code{rrd} generates random response times and decisions (in a \code{matrix}).
}
\description{
Density, distribution function, and random generation for the Ratcliff diffusion model with eight parameters: \code{a} (threshold separation), \code{v} (drift rate), \code{t0} (non-decision time/response time constant), \code{z} (relative starting point), \code{d} (differences in speed of response execution), \code{sv} (inter-trial-variability of drift), \code{st0} (inter-trial-variability of non-decisional components), and \code{sz} (inter-trial-variability of relative starting point).
