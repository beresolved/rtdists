Changes to Version 0.4-4

    o PDF and CDF LBA functions more robust (now mostly return 0 instead of NaN)
      for problematic parameter values (such as A = 0) [2015-09-17].

    o diffusion model functions are now completely vectorized and accept 
      vectors as parameters (including for boundary). This allows a likelihood
      function which only includes one call to the density function.
      
    o t0 in the diffusion model now corresponds to the lower bound of the 
      uniform distribution from which t0 is drawn (it was the mean before). 
      The specifications of t0 now agree between LBA and diffusion model. 
      
    o density for diffusion model is now always positive.
    
    o first argument in most functions (vector of response times) renamed to rt
      (was t before).
