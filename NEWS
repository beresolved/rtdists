Changes to Version 0.4-x

    o added diLBA() and riLBA().
      diLBA() is a fully vectorized versions of n1PDF which has response as
      second argument, allowing to get the density for each response and 
      corr esponding response time in one step. As for the diffusion model 
      (see below), this allows a likelihood function which only includes one 
      call to the density function.
      riLBA() is a fully vectorized version of the RNG functions and should be 
      used from now on as top-level function.
      
    o t0 in the LBA now accepts accumulator and trialwise parameters just as A 
      and b.

    o diffusion model functions are now completely vectorized and accept 
      vectors as parameters (including for boundary). As for the LBA, this 
      allows a likelihood function which only includes one call to the density
      function.
      
    o boundary parameter for diffusion functions accept numeric/factor vectors.
      
    o t0 in the diffusion model now corresponds to the lower bound of the 
      uniform distribution from which t0 is drawn (it was the mean before). 
      The specifications of t0 now agree between LBA and diffusion model. 
      
    o density for diffusion model is now always positive.
    
    o first argument in most functions (vector of response times) renamed to rt
      (was t before).
      
    o PDF and CDF LBA functions more robust (now mostly return 0 instead of NaN)
      for problematic parameter values (such as A = 0) [2015-09-17].
